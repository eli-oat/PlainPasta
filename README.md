# Plain Pasta

Plain Pasta is a tiny Mac app that makes "Paste and Match Style" the default copy/paste behavior.

It sits in your menu bar, and watches your clipboard for text, removes any styling from the text, and puts plaintext back on your clipboard.

I made this app because I rarely want styling to be copied to my clipboard. When I copy text, all I want is the text.

Download the most recent version of Plain Pasta from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hisaac/PlainPasta/releases).

## Attribution

Plain Pasta was inspired by another app called [FormatMatch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/formatmatch/id445211988?mt=12) by [Robert Wessels](http://www.robertwessels.com).

I've used FormatMatch for many years, and I would've happily used it for many more years to come, but the app hasn't been updated for over 6 years, and Robert Wessel's website hasn't been updated since 2016. I've been concerned for the continued life of the app, so I finally decided to take the time to write a new version using modern technologies.
