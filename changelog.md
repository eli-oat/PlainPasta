## [1.1.1] - 2020-09-07

### Changed

- Extracted pasteboard filtering to its own method as an extension on `NSPasteboardItem`

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in handling named URLs on the pasteboard by adding a few more types to the type filtered list:
	- `public.url-name`
	- `CorePasteboardFlavorType 0x75726C6E`
	- `WebURLsWithTitlesPboardType`
	- Dynamic pasteboard types, which are any type beginning with `dyn.` - I learned of these via [this blog post](https://camdez.com/blog/2010/07/21/nspasteboard-and-dynamic-utis/) by [@camdez](https://github.com/camdez)

## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-07

### Changed

- Move to using GCD instead of `Timer` for repeat polling of the pasteboard. This provides a small increase in performance.
- Update entitlements file to allow for automatic creation of App ID in App Store Connect
- Remove "Check for Updatesâ€¦" menu item, as this will now be done through the App Store
- Enable App Sandboxing for Mac App Store
- Enable hardened runtime
- Move Localizable.strings into Swift file

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that would cause images on the pasteboard to be removed ([reported](https://github.com/hisaac/PlainPasta/issues/3) by [@foigus](https://github.com/foigus). Thanks!)
